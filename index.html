                    <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam,</b> a visionary and a true gem of India, was born on <strong>October 15,
                            1931</strong>, in
                        Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu. His journey from a humble background to becoming one of India’s most
                        respected scientists and leaders is an inspiration to all. Dr. Kalam’s career in science and
                        technology was illustrious. He played a key role in the development of India’s space and missile
                        programs, earning him the title “Missile Man of India.” His work at ISRO and DRDO laid the
                        foundation for India's advancements in aerospace technology. In 2002, Dr. Kalam assumed the
                        office of the President of India. During his tenure, he continued to inspire the nation with his
                        wisdom and vision for a prosperous and developed India. He was known for his accessibility to
                        students and his commitment to education. His books, including “Wings of Fire” and “Ignited
                        Minds,” have motivated countless young minds to pursue their dreams relentlessly. Dr. Kalam’s
                        love for education led to initiatives like the “Kalam-Raju Tablet,” aimed at providing quality
                        education to remote areas. On July 27, 2015, India lost a great leader and a beloved scientist
                        when Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam passed away. However, his legacy as a role model, a symbol of
                        knowledge, humility, and dedication to the betterment of society, continues to inspire people of
                        all ages and backgrounds, not only in India but around the world.</p>
